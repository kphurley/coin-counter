# Coin Change

Given an integer array of coins[] of size N representing different types of currency and an integer sum, The task is to find the number of ways to make the sum by using different combinations from coins[].  

Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin, and that each element of coins will be unique. 

Input: sum = 4, coins[] = {1,2,3}, 
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four solutions: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 2}, {1, 3}. 

Input: sum = 10, coins[] = {2, 5, 3, 6}
Output: 5
Explanation: There are five solutions: 
{2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}.
